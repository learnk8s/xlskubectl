## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What?!**

A: The following quote best summarises this project:

> They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

**Q: No but really, what's going on here?!**

A: Kubernetes exposes a robust API that is capable of streaming incremental updates. Google Spreadsheet can be scripted to read and write values, so the next logical step is to connect the two (also, [credit to this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/ftgo69/sheet_ops_managing_kubernetes_using_google/)).

**Q: Is this production-ready?**

A: We're looking for fundings to take this to the next level. Replacing YAML with spreadsheets has always been our mission as a company, and we will continue to do so.
